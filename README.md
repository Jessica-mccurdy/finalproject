REGISTER

When you originally go to the home page of the site, register for an account by clicking the register button
in the top right corner of the page and entering valid information. Phone numbers must be 10 digit US numbers (you can enter them as
XXX-XXX-XXXX or XXXXXXXXXX or XXX XXX XXXX).

From there, you are logged in and can use the site's features: REQUEST, CLOSEST, UPDATE REQUEST, COMPLETE, CANCEL,
HISTORY, and SETTINGS.

LOG IN

Click in the top left of the screeen when not logged in to log in.

LOG OUT

Click in the top right once you are logged in to log out

REQUEST

First, input whether your flight is a departure or an arrival (not your uber). Next input valid information about your flight.
Dates should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD and times should be formatted as HH:MM:AM/PM (24 hour time if using a browser that does not
automatically format it).

CLOSEST

Select the ride request that you would like to find the closest ride to. This should be used if a user is not matched upon
submission of their request and is looking to extend their wait time.

UPDATE REQUEST

Select the ride request that you would like to update. Format information as you did in the original REQUEST.

COMPLETE

Here, a user may go to the Uber website where they may login and request a ride manually. In addition, the user can select the ride
request that they would like to mark as completedd.

CANCEL

Select the ride request that you would like to cancel.

HISTORY

Here the user sees a table of all past and current rides. There is a button at the bottom of the table where the user can delete
their history all at once.

SETTINGS

The user can update any of the information on their account that they want. Name, email, phone (must be formatted as a 10 digit US
phone number) can be changed without verification, but to change the password the user must input the current password and the new
one they would like to change it to (ya know, for security).
